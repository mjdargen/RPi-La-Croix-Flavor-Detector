# RPi-La-Croix-Flavor-Detector
This project uses a machine learning model that I created in Teachable Machine to help classify images from a webcam in real-time. The program is written in Python and uses OpenCV and TensorFlow. Includes an installation script to set up the development environment with Tensorflow and OpenCV for the Raspberry Pi. Demo model determines La Croix flavors. For more information about how I created the project and to learn how to create an object detection project yourself, you can view a demo video and read my Instructable detailing the project at the links below:
